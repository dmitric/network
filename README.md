Inspired by the twitter avatar of [@lifewinning](https://mobile.twitter.com/lifewinning). I wanted to be able to generate them in different colors and N-vertexes.

I also added a couple small animations to make things more interesting.

## Interactions

**Increase or decrease the number of vertex** - Swipe up or down, up and down keyboard keys

**Change colors** - You can change the background, top color, or bottom color using the color pickers.

**Toggle color pickers** - The 'c' key

**Regenerate** - The 'r' key

## Caveat

The browsers generally show SVG with the RGB color space, but once imported into something like illustrator, or if you export a PNG from an SVG in Sketch, it will display it in sRGB color space.
